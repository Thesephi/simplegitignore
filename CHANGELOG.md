# v0.1.5 (not published to npm)
- added test
- from now on, this package can only be published to npm if all tests pass

# v0.1.4
- only the (newly written) .gitignore file path is output to `stdout` while everything
else `stderr`. This helps make the script more easily integrated into other cli
tools.
- updated package description

# v0.1.3
- output to `stdout` on success (before it was `stderr`)
